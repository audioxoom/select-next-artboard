# Workflow Sketch Plugins
A collection of plugins I created to help with my sketch workflow. **A work in progress.** Hopefully you find some of them useful!

To install, double click on any of the .sketchplugin files and sketch will place them under the menu item "plugins."

Protip: Set a keyboard shortcut for any menu item in Sketch in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.

## Select Next Artboard, Select Previous Artboard
These plugins identify the current artboard you're working in and automatically select and zoom into the next artboard. Useful for moving through artboards as you present them or for quick edits between multiple artboards.

## Grazi
To the guys at [Bohemian Coding](https://twitter.com/bohemiancoding) for creating and constantly improving Sketch!

If you found any of these plugins useful, I'd love it if you [dropped me a note to let me know!](https://twitter.com/vrjbndr).
